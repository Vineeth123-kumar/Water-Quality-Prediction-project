# Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Water Quality Prediction** project!  
This project implements a simple yet effective machine learning model that classifies a water sample as **Safe** or **Not Safe** based on user-provided chemical and physical properties.

---

## What This Project Does

We use a clean dataset of water samples and train a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the safety of water based on features like:
- 💧 Ammonium (NH4)
- 💨 Dissolved Oxygen (O2)
- 🧪 Nitrates, Nitrites, Phosphates, Sulfates
- 🌫️ Suspended Solids
- and more!

✅ Safety labels are derived using real-world water quality thresholds (e.g., low NH4, high O2 = good water).
